I’m a machine learning enthusiast skilled in Python, R and SQL. I’ve worked with libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, NLTK and Gensim. 

I spent the past 8 months working at [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) as a Data Science Research Assistant on projects including predicting content quality metrics and studying the interaction between audiobook content and genre. Additionally, I worked with the Quantitative Investment Strategies team at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) as part of my data science capstone project, where I assessed pharmaceutical R&D similarity through FDA clinical trial metadata. 

As a student at Columbia, I’ve taken courses such as [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s18/) (with Andreas Müller, a Scikit-Learn core contributor), Applied Deep Learning, Algorithms and Exploratory Data Analysis (using R & D3.js). 

I enjoy the experimental process of model development, evaluation, optimization and deployment, and have experience writing production-level code.
